The following list shows cases where an Instruction evolves into a more complex version of an Instruction.

For each case, Stage 0 represents the Instruction in its initial state, and each subsequent Stage requires an increase in complexity based on the previous stage.
Please identify cases that failed to evolve, and provide their case ID and reasons.
Based on the reasons and the #Trajectory#, provide feedbacks to improve the evolution process.
If the evolution is passed, you don't need to provide reasons, but provide feedbacks in the context of not only complexity but also diversity, coherence.
